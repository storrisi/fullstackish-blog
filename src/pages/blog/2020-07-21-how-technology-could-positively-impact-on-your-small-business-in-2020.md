In 2020, the World as we know it has suffered a huge impact due to the spread of the Covid-19 virus.

Technology has played a key role during lockdowns all over the world.\
Many businesses needed to completely change the way they work to be able to overcome these dramatic days.

Many of them realized that their current online-presence was unable to allow them to survive, so they decided to try new ways of doing business online by introducing new digital solutions, such as collaborative tools, automatized booking systems, chatbots, virtual meetings, and so on.

What they unexpectedly discovered is that the changes they introduced actually simplified their processes, returning time to the people, and saving money that previously was used to pay expensive processes.\
Additionally, they were able to expand their audience, because of the positive impact of the smart solutions they adopted.

# What we all learned?

Over the past few decades, technology has significantly revolutionized the business world by making day by day technological improvements and innovations.

Nowadays there isn’t a business that could sustain itself without any digital solution.\
You can’t think to any company of freelancer that is working without the help of at least an Excel file, or an Email.

What we all discovered is that many of the activities that we previously thought they could be done only in person and manually, they were actually possible in a digital and remote way, faster and better.

We all overcome our scare for technology, due to our survival spirit.

# What’s the downside?

The problem that many CEO, Founder, and Small-Business owners face, is actually **which** solution introduce.\
They feel lost in the middle of all the possibilities that technology gives them today, while they still have to manage their business.

The consequence is that many businesses don’t have the time to research a new technology solution, because they are spending all of their time doing the same expensive things, day after day.

# Where to go from here?

How can a Small Business know that if there is a solution for its needs?\
How it can actually know that they have a problem that could be solved by a set of tools?

The answer is simple: **find a technology partner.**

You don’t have to hire developers if you don’t know what they have to do.\
You don’t have to buy expensive CRMs if they feel too much complicated for you.\
In both cases, you will waste a lot of money, and your feeling of unsuitability for technology will increase.

A technology partner could help you taking the right decisions because it will stay at your side, analyze your current processes, and suggest the right solutions or tools based on your specific needs.
